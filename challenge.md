Visualisation challenges: I sort of had it going in Mathematica just for 10-gons.

An app that allows you to
- pick the vertices of a closed polygon on a canvas
- calculates the intermediate polygons

One problem with the intermediate polygons is
- for acute angles the displacement is large
- can quickly lead to the intermediate polygons growing too large for your canvas
- Some rescaling is probably the way to go
Alternatively, since the end result is always the same no matter the order,
- apply angles in complementing pairs, jump out and in
- only show every second stage of the evolution

Maybe some app that allows to
- input a smooth curve
- allows to experiment with different polygon approximations
- see whether we get some convergence

The decomposition into the special types is a great one to animate.
